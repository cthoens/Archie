# Archie
Unity-based 3D jump-and-run puzzle game. The player character Archie jumps automatically when running towards an edge fast enough. The faster he runs the further he jumps. He has to escape by finding a path to the exit.

# Features and gameplay elements
- Two levels currently implemented (press Escape any time to jump to a level)
- Text popup based tutorial in the first level
- Buttons that open laser gates and active light bridges
- Deadly moving lazer beams
- Elevators

# Note on Assets
I modelled the geometry of the levels myself using Sketchup and created the climbing animation in Maya. Most of the other assets come from the Unity Asset Store (mostly the [Standard Assets for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/standard-assets-for-unity-2017-3-32351) package). Those assets are not part of this repo, but reside in their own private subrepo.
